Created Janurary 6th 2025

This Exclusive License Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by and between the author of the code and associated works ("Licensor"), and any individual or entity ("Licensee") who accesses, uses, copies, distributes, or references the code or associated works ("Licensed Works"). By accessing, using, copying, referencing, distributing, or otherwise interacting with the Licensed Works, the Licensee agrees to be fully bound by the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. If the Licensee does not agree to these terms, they must immediately cease all access and use of the Licensed Works.

1. Grant of License

1.1 Non-Commercial Use Only
The Licensor grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, and restricted license to use the Licensed Works solely for personal, non-commercial purposes. This license does not permit the Licensee to:

    Use the Licensed Works for any form of commercial activity, including but not limited to streaming, broadcasting, content creation, advertisement generation, monetized media, or any other activity involving potential or actual monetary, material, or economic compensation.
    Sell, redistribute, sublicense, lease, rent, or otherwise transfer any rights to the Licensed Works to any third party, regardless of whether the transaction involves financial or material exchange.
    Alter, modify, decompile, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works from the Licensed Works for any reason without obtaining explicit prior written consent from the Licensor.

2. Strict Prohibition of Use, Reference, and Copying

2.1 Prohibited Uses and Actions
The Licensee is explicitly prohibited from any of the following, unless the Licensor provides explicit, prior, and written consent:

    Content Creation and Streaming: The Licensee shall not use the Licensed Works, or any part thereof, in any publicly accessible media or platform, including but not limited to streaming services (e.g., Twitch, YouTube), social media posts, or any other form of media dissemination. This includes any form of content creation intended for public viewing, whether or not such activity results in any form of profit or material compensation.
    Commercial Gain: The Licensee shall not use the Licensed Works in any context that may generate or facilitate commercial gain, including sponsorships, partnerships, or advertising revenue.

    Derivative Works and References: The Licensee may not create derivative works, modifications, adaptations, or any references that include the Licensed Works, including any aspect thereof, whether directly or indirectly, in any new project, media, software, or content.

3. Explicit Permission Required for All Uses Beyond Personal, Non-Commercial Use

3.1 No Implied Permission
No rights, licenses, or permissions, express or implied, are granted to the Licensee except for the explicit, personal, and non-commercial use as outlined in this Agreement. All other uses of the Licensed Works, including but not limited to any commercial or public use, require express written permission from the Licensor.

3.2 Written Permission Only
For the avoidance of doubt, any use, reference, reproduction, or distribution of the Licensed Works that falls outside the scope of this Agreement, or otherwise violates its terms, will require explicit written approval from the Licensor. All requests for permission must be submitted in writing, and the Licensor retains the sole discretion to approve or deny any such requests.

4. Attribution and Acknowledgment

4.1 Attribution Requirement
In the event that the Licensor grants permission to the Licensee to use the Licensed Works, proper attribution must be provided to the Licensor in the form and manner specified by the Licensor. This includes the following:

    Clear, visible, and permanent attribution that identifies the Licensor as the creator of the Licensed Works.
    The attribution must be made in a manner that is consistent with any guidelines provided by the Licensor, and must be included wherever the Licensed Works are used, whether in physical or digital form, including content displayed via streaming, videos, or other publicly accessible platforms.

5. Ownership

5.1 Intellectual Property Rights
The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the Licensor retains full and exclusive ownership of all rights, title, and interest in and to the Licensed Works, including but not limited to all intellectual property rights, copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and other proprietary rights. The Licensee does not acquire any rights or ownership interest in the Licensed Works, other than the limited, non-commercial license expressly granted in this Agreement.

6. Enforcement of Rights

6.1 Legal Remedies and Enforcement
The Licensor retains the exclusive right to enforce this Agreement and take any necessary actions to protect their rights and interests in the Licensed Works. This includes the right to:

    Seek injunctive relief (including temporary and permanent injunctions) to prevent any unauthorized use, distribution, or exploitation of the Licensed Works.
    Pursue damages, including both actual damages and any statutory damages available under copyright law.
    Seek attorney's fees, costs, and any other remedy available under applicable law for violations of this Agreement.

6.2 Irreparable Harm
The Licensee acknowledges that any violation of this Agreement may result in irreparable harm to the Licensor, and that monetary damages alone may not be sufficient to remedy such harm. Therefore, the Licensor may seek equitable relief in addition to other available legal remedies.

7. Termination

7.1 Immediate Termination Upon Breach
This Agreement will terminate automatically upon any breach of its terms by the Licensee. Upon termination, the Licensee agrees to immediately cease all use of the Licensed Works, destroy any copies in their possession, and return any copies or materials containing the Licensed Works to the Licensor upon request.

7.2 Licensor’s Right to Terminate
The Licensor may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason, by providing written notice to the Licensee. Upon termination, the Licensee must immediately cease all access, use, and distribution of the Licensed Works and comply with the provisions of this section.

8. Indemnification

The Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from the Licensee's breach of this Agreement, including unauthorized use, modification, or distribution of the Licensed Works.

9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Licensor's jurisdiction, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any disputes arising under this Agreement shall be resolved in the courts of the Licensor's jurisdiction.

10. Entire Agreement and Modifications

10.1 Entire Agreement
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Licensor and Licensee concerning the use of the Licensed Works and supersedes all prior communications, agreements, or understandings, whether written or oral.

10.2 Modifications
No amendments or modifications to this Agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by both parties.

11. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and the invalid provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

12.1 Arbitration Requirement
Any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including its interpretation, performance, breach, or termination, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration, rather than in court. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or another mutually agreed-upon arbitration body. The arbitration will take place in a location determined by the Licensor, or at another mutually agreed-upon location.

12.2 Arbitration Procedure
The arbitration will be conducted by a neutral third-party arbitrator with experience in intellectual property law. The arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable, except as provided by law. The costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator, shall be borne by the losing party, unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator. Each party shall bear its own legal costs, unless the arbitrator orders otherwise.

12.3 Waiver of Right to Sue in Court
The Licensee waives any right to a trial by jury and agrees not to bring any claims in court, including claims for breach of contract, infringement of intellectual property rights, or any other legal claims arising under this Agreement. Instead, any such claims must be brought before the arbitrator in the manner outlined in this section.

12.4 Waiver of Counterclaims
The Licensee waives the right to counterclaim in any action brought against them by the Licensor in connection with this Agreement. Any counterclaim must be presented during arbitration as part of the same arbitration process, and not in a court of law. The Licensee acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is an essential part of the dispute resolution process, and agrees to be bound by the arbitrator’s decision.

12.5 Class Action Waiver
The Licensee agrees that they will not participate in any class action lawsuit or any other form of collective action arising from this Agreement. Any disputes will be handled on an individual basis and not as part of any group, collective, or class action. This clause is binding on both parties, and neither party may seek to consolidate claims or participate in any class action arising out of this Agreement.

12.6 Exceptions to Arbitration
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Licensor may seek injunctive relief (including, but not limited to, seeking orders to stop the unauthorized use of the Licensed Works) from a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Licensee. The Licensor retains the right to seek injunctive relief or other legal remedies to protect their intellectual property rights.

13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

13.1 Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensor resides, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

13.2 Exclusive Jurisdiction for Injunctive Relief
For the purposes of seeking injunctive relief (as provided for in Section 12.6), the parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the Licensor’s jurisdiction. All other disputes shall be resolved through arbitration as specified in Section 12.
